        <p>I am a Front End Web Developer where I recently earned a Certificate in the Full Stack Web Development Program at the University of Toronto. I seek to implement my skills to create functional and intuitive user experience websites. With my background in customer service I understand the importance of having a great customer/user experience whenever they interact with my websites.</p>
            <br/>
        <p>You can always expect me to bring passion, a collaborative spirit, and an eagerness to learn and improve whenever possible. I am also effective at combining my skills in communication, creativity and teamwork to finish tasks.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Health and Fitness is also one of my passions so when I'm not coding you could find me at a gym, soccer field or basketball court.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>I also love to travel. Before the travel restrictions were placed, I was in Mexico, Philippines, Cuba, and United States. Once the pandemic is done I hope to travel to Japan, El Salvador, Iceland.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>I am looking forward to adding my skills to an already well driven and quality oriented team. Please feel free to contact me. </p>
